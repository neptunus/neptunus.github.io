<p>
  Hello. I'm Neptúnus.<br>
  Among other things, I'm a programmer and web-designer.
<p>
  Send me an email if you'd like to get in touch, at <a href=mailto:n@ptun.us>n@ptun.us</a>;
  or look at my <a href=https://github.com/neptunus>github profile</a>
  if you're interested in my code.
<p>
  If you're into social media, I have an account on <a href=https://twitter.com/ptunus>twitter</a>.

  <summary>a little about me</summary>
  <p>
    I'm a front-end web-developer by trade,
    employed at <a href=https://www.gangverk.com>Gangverk</a>, the digital transformation agency,
    but I went to art school and graduated from that
    before I decided to get serious about programming.
  <p>
    I was always fascinated by computers growing up,
    and my fascination grew into a passion for the web in particular;
    as a platform for humans to connect,
    and to share,
    and to experiment, to create
    and to scream into a place where anybody could hear—if they were listening.
  <p>
    My mentor in the ways of the web was my childhood friend <a href=https://hdor.is>Halldór</a>.
    He taught me and included me in his projects,
    without which I don't know if I would have ended up where I have.
  <p>
    Before computers took over my brain, I thought I would become a writer.
    Of course, it's never too late.<br>
    If ever I write something I think is worth sharing with the world,
    I'll put it up here.
  <p>
    I was born in Reykjavík, which makes me Icelandic.
    However, my allegiance is to the human race.
    I wish we could be better to one another.
