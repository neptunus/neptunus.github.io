  Hello source-peeker!
  
  This site was written by hand.
  No build-phase or any fancy tooling used at all.
  The more I learn about web-development,
   the more I value simplicity in design and implementation.
  That doesn't mean minimalism for minimalism's sake,
   but carefully considering what's needed and what's not.
  I've taken a leaf out of Aaron D. Parks' book here,
   stripping the HTML down to its bare essentials.
  It's fun!
  Writing websites like this is a nice change of pace from working on gigantic web-applications;
   crackling with the power of 
   React™,
   state-in-javascript,
   css-in-javascript,
   continuous integration,
   component libraries,
   testing libraries,
   type checking
   and all the other reasons to pull one's hair out.
  This is my happy little place.

  But I feel the pull of the yak's furry coat.
  It's gotta get shaved some time~

    Hello.
    If you're here, 
    you might be looking for information about me;
    so I'll try to communicate something about who I am.
    It's a little tough—because labels repel me—but 
    you could describe me as a computers person.
    I make websites and apps,
    am comfortable in a variety of operating systems,
    manage quite well in both simple text-editors and full-blown IDEs,
    enjoy games 
    and read a lot of text online.
    Since my first encounter with a Mac in my childhood,
    I've been enthralled by glowing monitors 
    and the stuff we put on them.
  <p>
    I went to school for design and art at Fjölbrautaskólinn í Breiðholti,
    then later learned computer science at the Reykjavík Technical College.
    Since then, I've learned a lot on my own through work and side-projects.
  <p>
    Nowadays,
    I mostly find my paychecks in freelance web-work;
    most recently I've been working with Wordpress to make customized e-commerce environments,
    including a site with VOD & paywalled courses
    and an exhibition space that works with hundreds of artists at a time.
    I made an art-generator for Daði Freyr,
    drawing customized pixel-art faces to screen and exporting for custom printed shirts.
    I've worked on native iOS apps,
    set up backend systems in Python
    and brought visual designs to life
    for everything from entire websites to marketing emails.
  <p>
    That is all to say that I'm comfortable doing a variety of different work,
    independently or as part of a team.
    I'd like to move away from freelance to work more closely with others, 
    in a more structured environment,
    so if you'd like to get in touch,
    please feel free to send me a message:
