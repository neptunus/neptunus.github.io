  Hello source-peeker!
  
  This site was written by hand.
  No build-phase or any fancy tooling used at all.
  The more I learn about web-development,
   the more I value simplicity in design and implementation.
  That doesn't mean minimalism for minimalism's sake,
   but carefully considering what's needed and what's not.
  I've taken a leaf out of Aaron D. Parks' book here,
   stripping the HTML down to its bare essentials.
  It's fun!
  Writing websites like this is a nice change of pace 
   from working on gigantic web-applications;
   positively crackling with 
   the power of React™,
   state-in-javascript,
   css-in-javascript,
   continuous integration,
   component libraries,
   testing libraries,
   type checking
   and all the other reasons to pull one's hair out.
  This is my happy little place.

  But I feel the pull of the yak's furry coat.
  It's gotta get shaved some time~

    Hello~!<br>
    If you're here, 
    you might be looking for some information about me;
    so bear with me 
    as I try to communicate a little something about who I am.
    Any time I try this,
    it feels reductive.
    I guess that's the point, though.
  <p>
    My name is Neptúnus,
    and I suppose you could describe me as a computers person.
    I make websites and apps,
    am comfortable in a variety of operating systems,
    manage quite well in both simple text-editors and full-blown IDEs,
    enjoy games 
    and read a lot of text online.
    Since my first encounter with a Mac in my childhood,
    I've been enthralled by glowing monitors 
    and the stuff we put on them.
  <p>
    Other interests include
    science fiction and other literarure,
    fundamental human rights,
    hiking,
    cooking,
    bodyweight fitness,
    and the arts;
    admiring and taking part in them.
    I have a particularly soft spot for pixel-art,
    and have dabbled in it a little myself.<br>
    I aspire to improve my writing.
  <p>
    I went to school for design and art at Fjölbrautaskólinn í Breiðholti.
    Later on, I studied computer science at the Reykjavík Technical College.
    Since then, 
    I've learned a lot on my own through work and side-projects.
    Mostly, I've come to admire simplicity in all things.
  <p>
    Nowadays,
    I'm employed as a developer at <a href=https://www.gangverk.is>Gangverk</a>;
    modeling content,
    writing components,
    updating documentation
    and learning the ins and outs of the business we're working for.
    Before I started doing all that,
    I did a bit of freelance work.
    Using Wordpress to make customized e-commerce environments,
    including a site that features VOD & paywalled courses,
    and an exhibition space that works in conjunction with hundreds of artists at a time.
    I made a web-app that can generate personalized pixel-art avatars,
    rendering the customized art in <a href=https://dadifreyr.is>Daði Freyr</a>'s distinctive style
    and exporting to be printed on personal sweatshirts
    or used on social media as a profile picture.
    I've worked on native iOS apps,
    set up backend systems in Python
    and brought visual designs to life
    for everything from entire websites to marketing emails.
  <p>
    As I continue writing,
    I get the urge to set up some kind of system
    to manage posts of different kinds.
    I want to maintain an RSS feed,
    post artwork,
    blog—or even microblog…<br>
    This happens to a lot of us, I think.
