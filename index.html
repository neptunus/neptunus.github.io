  Hello source-peeker!

  This site was written by hand.
  No build-phase or any fancy tooling used at all.
  The more I learn about web-development,
   the more I value simplicity in design and implementation.
  That doesn't mean minimalism for minimalism's sake,
   but carefully considering what's needed and what's not.
  I've taken a leaf out of Aaron D. Parks' book here,
   stripping the HTML down to its bare essentials.
  It's fun!
  Writing websites like this is a nice change of pace
   from working on gigantic web-applications;
   positively crackling with
   the power of React™,
   state-in-javascript,
   css-in-javascript,
   continuous integration,
   component libraries,
   testing libraries,
   type checking
   and all the other reasons to pull one's hair out.
  This is my little happy place.

  But I feel the pull of the yak's furry coat.
  It's gotta get shaved some time.

    Hello.<br>
    If you're here, you might be looking for some information about me;
    so bear with me as I try to communicate a little something about who I am.

  <p>
    I wrote the first version of this as sort of an introduction to my CV.
    Now I've been gainfully employed in the web industry for two years
    and I'm itching to blog.

  <hr>

  <p>
    My name is Neptúnus.
    I suppose you could describe me as a computers person.
    Or an artist.
    Human being.
    I make websites and apps,
    am comfortable in a variety of operating systems,
    manage quite well in both simple text-editors and full-blown IDEs,
    enjoy games
    and read a lot.
    Since my first encounter with a Mac in my childhood,
    I've been enthralled by glowing monitors
    and the stuff we put on them.

  <p>
    Other interests include
    science fiction and other literarure,
    basic human rights,
    hiking,
    cooking,
    and the arts;
    admiring and taking part in them.
    I have a particularly soft spot for expression in the digital space,
    in the form of pixel-art,
    and have dabbled in it a little myself.<br>
    I aspire to improve my writing.

  <p>
    I studied the fundamentals of art and graphic design at Fjölbrautaskólinn í Breiðholti.
    I studied the fundamentals of computer science at the Reykjavík Technical College.
    I never went to university.

  <p>
    Nowadays,
    I'm employed as a developer at <a href=https://www.gangverk.is>Gangverk</a>;
    modeling content,
    writing front-end code,
    updating documentation
    and learning the ins and outs of the business we're working for.
    Before I started doing all that,
    I did a bit of freelance work.
    Using Wordpress to make customized e-commerce environments,
    including a site that features VOD & paywalled courses,
    and an exhibition space that works in conjunction with hundreds of artists at a time.<br>
    I made a web-app that can generate personalized pixel-art avatars,
    rendering the customized art in <a href=https://dadifreyr.is>Daði Freyr</a>'s distinctive style
    and exporting to be printed on personal sweatshirts
    or used on social media as a profile picture.<br>
    I've worked on native iOS apps,
    set up backend systems in Python
    and brought visual designs to life
    for everything from marketing emails to entire websites.

  <p>
    As I continue marking up this website,
    I get the urge to set up some kind of system
    to manage posts of different kinds.
    I want to maintain an RSS feed,
    post artwork,
    blog—or even microblog…<br>
    This sort of thing happens to a lot of us, I think.

  <p>
    Well, stay tuned.

  <p>
    — Neptúnus
