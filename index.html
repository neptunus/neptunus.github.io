<!-- Hello source-peeker! This site was written by hand, no build-phase or any fancy tooling used at all. A simple site like this hardly needs React and Webpack. I have a certain nostalgia for simple styles, and letting the browser do a lot of the heavy lifting of layout and style. CSS is great, but not everything has to be dripping with M O D E R N ~ D E S I G N. Plain markup and simple styles (max-width is the MVP here) are underrated these days. -->

  <p>Hello. If you're here, you might be looking for information about me; so I'll try to communicate something about who I am. It's a little tough, because labels repel me, but you could describe me as a computers person. I make websites and apps, am comfortable in a variety of operating systems, manage quite well in both simple text-editors and full-blown IDEs, enjoy games and read a lot of text online. Since my first encounter with a Mac in my childhood, I've been enthralled by glowing monitors and the stuff we put on them.</p>
  <p>I went to school for design and art at Fjölbrautaskólinn í Breiðholti, then later learned computer science at the Reykjavík Technical College. Since then, I've learned a lot on my own, through work and side-projects.</p>
  <p>Nowadays, I mostly find my paychecks in freelance web-work; most recently I've been working with Wordpress to make customized e-commerce environments, including a site with VOD & paywalled courses and an exhibition space that works with hundreds of artists at a time. I made an art-generator for Daði Freyr, drawing customized pixel-art faces to screen and exporting for custom printed shirts. I've worked on native iOS apps, set up backend systems in Python and brought visual designs to life for everything from entire websites to marketing emails.</p>
  <p>That is all to say that I'm comfortable doing a variety of different work, independently or as part of a team. I'd like to move away from freelance to work more closely with others, in a more structured environment, so if you'd like to get in touch, please send me a message:</p>
